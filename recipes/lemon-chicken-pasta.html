    <h2>Pecorino Romano and Parmesan give cheesy flavor to this easy lemon-chicken 
        pasta dish that's sure to please the whole family!</h2>
        <p>Great easy pasta, and definitely pleases the family like the recipe says. 
           That being said, I personally think it needs a little more seasoning, so I 
           recommend adding some more salt, pepper, and possibly a little garlic powder 
           to taste.</p>

           <h3 class="list">Ingredients</h3>
           <ul class="list">
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package linguine pasta</li>
            <li>1 cup frozen peas</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) package button mushrooms, sliced</li>
            <li>½ cup diced onion</li>
            <li>1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch chunks</li>
            <li>kosher salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>½ (8 ounce) package reduced-fat cream cheese, cubed and softened</li>
            <li>¼ cup fresh lemon juice</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons lemon zest</li>
            <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>¼ cup grated Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
            <li>¼ cup chopped flat-leaf (Italian) parsley</li>
            <li>1/4 cup water</li>
           </ul>

           <h3 class="list">Steps</h3>
           <ol class="list">
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook linguine 
                at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes, adding 
                frozen peas during the last 2 minutes of cooking time. Drain pasta and 
                peas, reserving 1 cup cooking liquid.</li>
            <li>While the pasta is cooking, heat butter and olive oil in a large skillet 
                over medium-high heat. Add mushrooms and onion; cook until mushrooms are brown, 
                5 to 7 minutes.</li>
            <li>Season chicken with salt and pepper. Cook in the same skillet over medium-high 
                heat until browned and no longer pink, 7 to 10 minutes. Add the mushrooms back 
                to the skillet. Add cream cheese, lemon juice, and lemon zest; stir until cream 
                cheese is melted. Remove from heat.</li>
            <li>Fold in Parmesan and Pecorino Romano cheeses, then parsley. Toss with pasta and 
                peas, adding reserved cooking liquid as necessary to make a sauce.</li>
